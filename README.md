## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **Mini Visualization Dashboard** built using the Student Performance dataset. It analyzes how academic, behavioral, and social factors influence student performance using data visualization techniques.

Two datasets representing **Mathematics** and **Portuguese** performance are merged to provide a comprehensive view of student achievement.

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** Student Performance Dataset
* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Files Used:**

  * `student-mat.csv` (Math scores)
  * `student-por.csv` (Portuguese scores)

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

The following features were created to enhance analysis:

* 📊 Average Score
* 🏷️ Performance Category (High / Medium / Low)
* ⏱️ Study Time Category
* 📉 Absence Level
* 🔄 Score Difference

---

## 📊 Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations such as:

* 📈 Score Distribution
* 📚 Study Time vs Performance
* 🚶 Absences vs Performance
* 🔗 Math vs Portuguese Score Comparison
* 📊 Performance Category Distribution
* 📉 Failures vs Performance
* 🔥 Correlation Heatmap

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 🐍 Python
* 📦 Pandas, NumPy
* 📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn
* 💻 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* 📚 Higher study time leads to better performance
* 🚶 More absences reduce academic scores
* 🔗 Strong correlation exists between subjects
* 📉 Past failures negatively impact performance
* 🍺 Lifestyle factors may influence results

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Student performance is influenced by a combination of study habits, attendance, academic history, and personal behavior. Data visualization helps in identifying these patterns effectively and supports better understanding of performance factors.
